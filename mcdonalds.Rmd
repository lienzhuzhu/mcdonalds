## Is McDonald's *really* that unhealthy?

Chad Ochocinco Johnson advises athletes under his mentorship to eat McDonald's daily, for multiple meals every day (though, it should be noted that he is a franchisee) and I love the food at McDonald's. It's a solid product.

But public perception scrutinizes this nutritional plan.

So, here we are today to determine if it's possible to eat healthy at McDonald's.


## Some questions to answer...

### **1. Is there a balance of macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs) in McDonald’s menu items?**

**Analysis Ideas**:

- Calculate the ratio of macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs) to total calories for each menu item.
- Identify menu items with a high protein-to-calorie ratio or a balanced macronutrient distribution.
- Highlight items that could be considered "nutritionally balanced."

**Visualization**:

- Stacked bar chart or ternary plot showing the proportion of calories from protein, fat, and carbs for different menu items or categories.

### **2. What are the healthiest options in terms of low saturated fat and high protein?**

**Analysis Ideas**:

- Rank items based on a "health score" (e.g., high protein, low saturated fat, low total calories).
- Highlight items suitable for fitness enthusiasts or those with specific dietary goals.

**Visualization**:

- Scatter plot of "saturated fat" vs. "protein," highlighting "healthy" items.
- Bar chart showing "top 5 healthiest menu items."

### **3. How does McDonald’s menu compare to daily recommended nutritional values?**

**Analysis Ideas**:

- Compare the nutritional content (calories, sodium, cholesterol) of menu items to daily recommended limits.
- Highlight items that contribute significantly to or exceed daily intake recommendations.

**Visualization**:

- Bar chart showing percentage of daily recommended intake contributed by key items (e.g., calories, sodium).
- Heatmap showing items that exceed certain thresholds.

### **4. Are there menu items with healthier fat sources?**

**Analysis Ideas**:

- Investigate items with high "other_fat" (fat not from saturated or trans fats) as potentially healthier fat sources.
- Identify menu categories with the least saturated and trans fats.

**Visualization**:

- Histogram of "other_fat" across menu items.
- Stacked bar chart of fat types (saturated, trans, other) by menu category.

### **5. Can McDonald’s menu fit into weight-loss or fitness plans?**

**Analysis Ideas**:

- Calculate protein-to-calorie ratios and highlight high-protein, low-calorie options.
- Show how menu items could fit within a 500-calorie meal limit or a fitness-oriented diet.

**Visualization**:

- Scatter plot of "calories" vs. "protein," color-coded by category.
- Table of items under 500 calories with high protein content.
